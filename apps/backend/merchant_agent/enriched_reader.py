"""
Read helpers for products_enriched.

Raw `products` rows are the golden source and never mutated. Enrichment writes
land in `products_enriched` keyed by (product_id, strategy). Callers pick which
strategy they want and merge enriched attributes on top of raw at query time.

Typical usage:

    raw = db.query(Product).filter_by(product_id=pid).one()
    enriched = fetch_enriched(db, pid, strategy="normalizer_v1")
    combined = combine_raw_and_enriched(raw.attributes or {}, enriched)

Each table owns its fields: enriched_attributes must not carry keys that
also exist in raw_attributes. `combine_raw_and_enriched` asserts this so a
silent overwrite cannot happen.
