Knowledge Graph Service for Electronics Products.

Implements Neo4j integration for complex constraint-based queries.
Focuses on electronics (laptops, components, compatibility).

Per week4notes.txt:
- Knowledge graph for verification and reasoning
- Handle complex queries like "gaming PC with components X, Y, Z under budget B"
- Graph algorithms for constraint satisfaction
- Real electronics data (not synthetic)
