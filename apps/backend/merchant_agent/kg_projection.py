"""KG projection — flatten raw ``products`` + ``products_enriched`` rows
onto :Product node properties consumed by the Cypher reader in kg_service.

This module is the single place where the KG *writer* and *reader* agree on
the property set. Reader calls in ``kg_service._build_cypher_query`` reference
properties like ``p.good_for_ml``, ``p.battery_life_hours``, ``p.brand``;
those must be producible here (via identity fields or a flattening rule) or
the scorer silently falls to 0 (the original #51 bug).

Contract, verbatim from issue #52:
  - Direction is one-way: products_enriched → KG. Builders don't re-derive
    features from raw text.
  - The Cypher scorer defines the property set.
  - Per-(merchant_id, strategy) keying.
  - Identity fields come from raw; derived fields come only from enriched.

Design notes
------------
The projection is not a hardcoded property list — the merchant agent is
catalog-generic (laptop today, fashion or groceries tomorrow) and
``soft_tagger_v1`` has an open tag vocabulary. Property names (``good_for_ml``,
``calories_kcal``, …) are discovered from enriched rows at build time.

The contract drift test in ``tests/test_kg_contract.py`` verifies the *shape*
contract: every property name the reader references must either be an
identity field, a known raw attribute key, or producible by some strategy's
flattening rule. New catalog domain ⇒ add a flattening rule, not a projection
list edit.
