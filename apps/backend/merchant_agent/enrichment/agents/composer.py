"""composer_v1 — single writer of the canonical enriched row (issues #83, #88).

Today's enrichment pipeline lets every strategy (taxonomy, parser, specialist,
scraper, soft_tagger) write its own (product_id, strategy, attributes) row;
reads pivot by strategy at the inspector's combine step. That means:

  - hallucinated or ungrounded values still land in the table
  - two strategies can claim overlapping keys with no tie-break
  - verbose narrative output (specialist_capabilities, specialist_audience)
    sits alongside factual output with no separation

The composer is the structural fix: it is the **only** agent allowed to
emit canonical catalog fields. Every other strategy still writes its own
row — but downstream readers prefer composer output when present.

v1 scope
--------
  - Reads every upstream strategy's output from the runner's ``context``
    dict (populated in orchestration/runner.py: ``ctx[_short(strategy)] =
    output.attributes``).
  - Also reads ``ctx["_validator_notes"]`` so the composer knows which
    strategies the validator rejected (e.g. ram_gb out of bounds) and can
    reason about the resulting gap rather than silently ignore it.
  - Runs one LLM call (gpt-5 by default — see ``composer_model()``) with
    the full findings + raw row + policy:
        * no-hallucination: drop values not grounded in raw / parsed /
          scraped evidence
        * per-key precedence (see _PRECEDENCE_NOTE below): taxonomy owns
          product_type; parser/scraper own specs (scraper wins on tie
          because it's from the manufacturer page); soft_tagger owns
          good_for_* tags; specialist contributes only structured
          use-case-fit, never prose
        * echo applies to FINDINGS not the canonical row: a grounded
          value still belongs in composed_fields even if raw_attributes
          also has it — downstream readers should be able to read the
          canonical row without re-joining raw
        * type discipline: scalars stay scalar; flatten parsed_specs /
          scraped_specs one level up; drop narrative keys (via the
          registry's self-declared NARRATIVE_KEYS, not a hardcoded list)
  - Deterministic fallback: if the LLM errors or returns unparseable
    JSON, the composer still writes a row built from upstream findings
    (flatten parsed/scraped specs, union soft_tags, take product_type
    from taxonomy) with ``notes='deterministic_fallback'``. One product
    never loses its canonical row to a transient API blip.
  - Writes:
        composed_fields       flat dict {key: value} the composer decided
                              belongs on the canonical row
        composer_decisions    list[ComposerDecision] — audit log for the
                              cell-lineage UX in #81
        composed_at           ISO timestamp

1:1 enforcement policy (issue #88)
------------------------------------
Every key in ``composed_fields`` MUST have a matching entry in
``composer_decisions``. The composer instructs the LLM to comply, but compliance
is not guaranteed. After the LLM returns, ``_reconcile_composer_output`` enforces
this **leniently with synthesis**: any composed key that has no decision gets a
synthesized ``ComposerDecision`` marked ``source_kind=PARAMETRIC`` and
``reason='decision_synthesized_from_composed_fields'``. The row ships in full;
``attributes['incomplete_decisions'] = True`` flags the gap for the inspector.

source_kind provenance taxonomy (vision bullet 3 / #88)
--------------------------------------------------------
``ComposerDecision.source_kind`` (a ``SourceKind`` enum) classifies each
composed field by how its value was obtained:

  RAW_PARSE            — parser_v1 extracted it from raw catalog text
  SCRAPE               — scraper_v1 crawled the manufacturer page
  PARAMETRIC           — LLM world knowledge (specialist_v1, taxonomy_v1,
                         soft_tagger_v1, composer alone, or echoes from raw)
  DETERMINISTIC_FALLBACK — rule-based pass-through (no LLM inference)

The reconciler infers ``source_kind`` from ``source_strategy`` via
``_STRATEGY_TO_SOURCE_KIND``. If ``source_strategy`` is unknown, the field
defaults to ``PARAMETRIC`` and a warning is logged so the gap is visible.

Live validation caveat
-----------------------
The live mocklaptops enrichment run currently returns uniformly empty composer
output (task #12 investigates root cause). All validation for this PR is
therefore synthetic-fixture-only — see ``tests/enrichment/test_composer.py``.

# _TODO(closed_loop) — #85 attach points
# ---------------------------------------
# This composer is a single-shot LLM synthesizer. #85 (agentic pipeline
# gaps) calls out that real agentic behavior needs feedback loops. When
# we graduate to composer_v2, the hooks land in specific places below:
#
#   - _gather_findings(): point where a "request more evidence" edge
#     would fire back at scraper/parser for keys that are specialist-
#     asked-about but unground (#85 points 1, 12)
#   - post-LLM composed block: point where self-critique + revise loop
#     would run ("compose -> critique -> maybe re-compose") (#85 pt 4, 8)
#   - low-confidence merges: point where human escalation hook would
#     surface a clarification request (#85 pt 11)
#
# None of these land in this PR — but noting the attach points so the
# next iteration doesn't have to rediscover them.

v2+ (follow-ups, deliberately out of scope)
-------------------------------------------
  - Retire the per-strategy rows into a ``products_findings_<m>`` table
    and promote composer output into a flat-schema catalog. Tracked in
    #83's "Findings surface shape" open question.
  - Closed-loop refinement (see attach points above) (#85).
  - Confidence-weighted merges across duplicate sources.

    "you MUST emit a matching entry in `composer_decisions` with `key` "
    "equal to that field name. Do not ship a composed value without a "
